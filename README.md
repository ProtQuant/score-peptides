# score-peptides
**stage one of the project**

* I am not familiar with github. So I put all my files here. I will delete some useless files later.
* The latest version of code is src/ProduceLabel7.py. It will process files in Testcases3/flyquant. The other 3 folders in Testcases3 are generated by the code.
* The code is not finished yet. (Same with the one sent in the teams)
  * more comments and explanations are needed
  * more test cases are needed
  * need to change unseen peptides
  * some changes of "\\\" in file path



other info:

* ProduceLabel7.py can run directly 

* flydata_example3 contains all the peptides information from the new data
* uniprot-proteome_UP000000803.fasta contains protein formula
* ignore Test.py, Testcases, Testcases2
